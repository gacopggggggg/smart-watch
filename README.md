## Features
- Organized data for easy preprocessing and model training.
- Supports custom and augmented datasets.
- Includes Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.
- Provides automation scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Stores trained models and visualized results.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- GPU (optional but recommended for deep learning tasks)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
   cd your_project
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up data:
   - Place `fer2013.csv` or other raw data files in the `data/raw/` directory.

4. Configure hyperparameters:
   - Update `config.yaml` for training settings and paths.

## Usage
### Preprocessing Data
To preprocess raw data and organize it into training and testing sets:
```bash
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
```

### Data Augmentation
To augment the training dataset:
```bash
python scripts/augment_data.py
```

### Model Training
To train the model:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### Model Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model on the test dataset:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
```

### Visualizations
- Training and validation curves are saved in the `results/` directory.

## Results
- Confusion matrix: `results/confusion_matrix.png`
- Accuracy curve: `results/accuracy_curve.png`
- Loss curve: `results/loss_curve.png`
